### TeaLink
TeaLink is a Dapp written in mostly Typescript and provides users a way to interact with the BetGame.sol contract.  Here users are able to create bets, accept bets and check bets all from within the UI.  We use Metmask and Moralis for signing users in and require them to be on the Kovan network for full functionality.  If a user does not have metamask installed, the bet marketplace is avaible to view but not to interact with.  Our Chat page is built using Roomlio which provides users with a way to communicate with eachother to boost community and comradery.
